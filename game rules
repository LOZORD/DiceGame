HOW LEO'S DICE GAME WORKS

With an odd/3-sided die:
Both players roll
A beats B
B beats C
C beats A
...

For every round of rolling a player comes out victorious, gaining 1 point 
OR 
Both players gain nothing (equal roll)

If a player is X amount of points separate the players:
betting can take place to even the odds
-or boost someone even farther

The first player to get to Y (probably 21) wins
HOWEVER
if farther player doesn't get to 21 exactly (due to a successful bet)
they are reversed in the other direction, and begin losing points (back to zero)
GETTING TO 0 BECOMES THE NEW GOAL FOR THAT PLAYER
(winning a round produces negative points--a good thing for the reverse player)
Zero can be "jumped over/through" unlike 21 (by winning a bet)

If the reverse player gets to zero before the other player STILL
The reversed player wins
